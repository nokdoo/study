A practical note: if the tree becomes "unbalanced" because the words dont' arrive in random order, the running time of the program can grow too much.
As a worst case, if the words are already in order, this program does an expensive simulation of linear search.
There are generalizations of the binary tree that do not suffer from this worst-case behavior, but we will not describe them here.
