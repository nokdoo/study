I'm so happy to talk you again

The surprise was not just yours

I had no idea that you had found my little country house until I was just a few steps from the door

Did you think that I was the criminal?

I didn't know who you were

I saw you then. 
나는 너를 그때 봤어

You are always of very great value to me
너는 항상 나에게 정말 귀중한 존재야

Please forgive me if you are feeling tricked

Why not tell me you were here?
왜 여기에 있다는 것을 말하지 않았지? (are이 아님)

That's why I brought Cartwright with me

I've read all of them more than once

Tell me about your visit to Lyons

It had become cool and dark so we went into the hut
(It은 그냥 상황을 말해줌)

I told Holmes of my talk with the lady
(of)

Because he knew that she would be much more useful to him in the character of a free woman

Now I began to see the evil which I had only guessed at before

The scream came again, even louder and nearer
(even : 비교급 강조)

He started running at top speed over the moor
(at)

I saw Holmes put his hand to his head like a man in pain
(like, in)

I was a fool to wait so long
바보 같이 내가 너무 오래 기다렸어

You see what happens when you forget your duties!
의무를 잊어버리면 어떤 일이 일어나는지 알았겠지

I shall never forgive myself for leaving him to this fate
내가 그를 떠나 이런 운명을 맞게 했으니 나는 나 자신을 절대 용서 못할 거야

I am more to blame than you
비난해야 할 사람은 네가 아니고 나야

In order to complete my case I have killed the man I tried to help
사건을 완벽하게 하려고 내가 도와주어야 하는 사람을 죽이고 말았어

Where is the hound which chased him to his death?
(which)

This was still a tragedy, but this man deserved to die

It was the clothes that killed this poor devil

I certainly didn't expect to see you out here at this time of night

He ran past me and bent down to look at the dead man

I heard a shocked sound in his throat

How do you think this poor fellow died?

One cannot always be successful
한 사람이 항상 성공할 수는 없죠

It has not been a very satisfying case
이것은 납득할 수 없는 경우에요

Looking back we saw him walking slowly away over the moor
우리는 고개를 돌려 그가 황부지를 천천히 걸어가는 모습을 봤다
